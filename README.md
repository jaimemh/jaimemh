### Hi there, I am Jaime ðŸ‘‹

I am the Co-founder of [SurrealDB](https://surrealdb.com) - the ultimate cloud database for tomorrow's applications. SurrealDB is a scalable, distributed, collaborative, document-graph database, for the realtime web. Our source code is [available on Github](https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb). [Give us a star](https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb) if you like what we are building!

Aside from business I'm likely either chasing my three children, a table tennis ball, a basketball, or a shuttlecock, as my passion is undoubtedly sport. I run a number of not-for-profit organisations in the sport sector aimed at underprivileged children and vulnerable or disabled adults. I am also Board Director at British Para Table Tennis.
